\section*{Application Overview}
The \texttt{application.py} file serves as the central hub for a comprehensive Streamlit-based data anonymization and processing application. Upon initialization, it imports essential libraries such as \texttt{pandas}, \texttt{streamlit}, and various utility modules from the \texttt{src} directory, which include functions for data loading, binning, geocoding, and synthetic data generation. The application begins by configuring the Streamlit page through the \texttt{setup\_page} function, which sets the page title, layout, and applies custom styles to enhance the user interface. This function also displays the main title of the application, ``Dynamic De-Identification,'' establishing the primary purpose of the tool.

The sidebar, rendered by the \texttt{sidebar\_inputs} function, provides users with interactive widgets for uploading datasets, selecting output file types (\texttt{csv} or \texttt{pkl}), and choosing binning methods such as ``Quantile'' or ``Equal Width''. It also includes sections for displaying application logs and managing session state information, ensuring that users can monitor the application's internal processes and maintain continuity across different interactions. The sidebar is further enriched with expandable sections that reveal detailed session state logs and variable types, facilitating a deeper understanding of the application's state at any given moment.

Data handling is meticulously managed through functions like \texttt{run\_processing\_cached}, which leverages Streamlit's caching mechanism to efficiently process and save data. This function initializes a \texttt{DataProcessor} instance with parameters such as thresholds for date and numeric detection, factor ratios, and date formats, ensuring that the data is appropriately prepared for subsequent anonymization tasks. The \texttt{load\_and\_preview\_data} and \texttt{save\_raw\_data} functions handle the loading of uploaded datasets, previewing the data within the interface, and saving it in the selected format, respectively. These processes are crucial for maintaining data integrity and providing users with immediate feedback on their uploaded datasets.

The application is organized into multiple tabs, each encapsulating distinct functionalities. The \texttt{binning\_tab} function allows users to manually bin selected columns using the chosen binning method. It offers interactive elements for selecting columns to bin, configuring binning options, and initiating the binning process. Upon completion, it provides summaries and integrity assessments of the binned data, alongside visualization tools such as density plots and association rule mining features. Similarly, the \texttt{location\_granulariser\_tab} focuses on geocoding geographical data, enabling users to detect geographical columns, perform geocoding, and generate granular location information with options to visualize the results on maps.

Users can train models, generate synthetic samples, and download the results directly from the interface, with visual comparisons between original and synthetic data distributions to validate the synthesis process.

Throughout the application, logging is meticulously configured to capture both real-time logs and file-based logs, ensuring that users can monitor application behavior and troubleshoot issues effectively. The \texttt{display\_logs} function integrates these logs into the Streamlit interface, providing transparency and aiding in debugging. The \texttt{main} function orchestrates the overall workflow, initializing session states, handling file uploads, configuring logging based on user preferences, and coordinating the rendering of different tabs based on user interactions. Finally, the \texttt{help\_tab} offers comprehensive documentation and guidance, ensuring users can navigate and utilize the application's features effectively. Overall, \texttt{application.py} is a robust and user-centric application designed to facilitate dynamic data anonymization, ensuring data privacy while maintaining analytical utility.

\section*{Data Binning Framework}
The data binning process is fundamental to the application's anonymization capabilities, enabling the generalization of data to obscure individual records while preserving overall data utility.

\subsection*{DataBinner Class}
The \texttt{DataBinner} class in \texttt{data\_binner.py} is designed to categorize specified columns in a Pandas DataFrame based on user-defined bin counts and chosen binning methods, such as ``quantile'' or ``equal width''. Upon initialization, it validates the selected binning method and prepares to handle various data types, including datetime, integer, float, and categorical columns. The \texttt{bin\_columns} method takes a dictionary mapping column names to their respective bin counts, applying the appropriate binning strategy to each column while categorizing them based on their data types. For numerical columns, it employs either \texttt{pd.cut} for equal width binning or \texttt{pd.qcut} for quantile-based binning, ensuring that each bin is appropriately labeled and that the number of bins does not exceed the number of unique values in the column. Categorical columns are handled by grouping categories based on frequency, facilitating the reduction of dimensionality while preserving significant patterns within the data.

\subsection*{DataIntegrityAssessor Class}
Transitioning to \texttt{data\_integrity\_assessor.py}, the \texttt{DataIntegrityAssessor} class plays a critical role in evaluating the impact of the binning process on the dataset's integrity. It takes the original and binned DataFrames as input and first validates that both DataFrames have identical columns and that the relevant columns are of categorical types. The \texttt{assess\_integrity\_loss} method calculates the entropy for each column before and after binning, determining the entropy loss and its percentage relative to the original entropy. This quantitative assessment provides insights into how much information has been lost due to binning, which is crucial for balancing data privacy and utility. Additionally, the class offers functionalities to generate and save integrity reports, visualize entropy changes through bar plots, and compute overall entropy loss across all columns. Beyond entropy analysis, the \texttt{generate\_association\_rules} method leverages the Apriori algorithm to uncover association rules within both the original and binned datasets, facilitating a comparative analysis of how binning affects underlying relationships in the data.

\subsection*{UniqueBinIdentifier Class}
Finally, the \texttt{unique\_bin\_identifier.py} file introduces the \texttt{UniqueBinIdentifier} class, which is essential for identifying unique observations in the original DataFrame based on combinations of binned columns. By iterating through various combinations of specified columns, it determines how many unique records exist within each combination, effectively highlighting the granularity and distinctiveness introduced by the binning process. The \texttt{find\_unique\_identifications} method allows users to specify the range of combination sizes to consider, systematically evaluating each combination to count the number of unique identifications. This analysis is instrumental in understanding the extent to which binning contributes to data anonymization, as higher numbers of unique identifications may indicate a need for more aggressive binning or additional anonymization techniques. The class also provides methods to save the results of this analysis and visualize the top combinations that yield the highest number of unique identifications, offering a clear and actionable overview of the dataset's uniqueness post-binning.

Together, these classes provide a comprehensive toolkit for data preprocessing, ensuring that binning operations are performed methodically, their effects are thoroughly assessed, and the resulting data maintains a balance between privacy and analytical value. By integrating \texttt{DataBinner} for effective binning, \texttt{DataIntegrityAssessor} for evaluating the integrity of the binning process, and \texttt{UniqueBinIdentifier} for pinpointing unique records, the system ensures a structured and informed approach to data anonymization and preparation within the broader application framework.

\section*{Data Processing}
The \texttt{DataProcessor} class within the \texttt{Process\_Data.py} file serves as a pivotal component for preprocessing datasets in the data anonymization and analysis pipeline. Upon instantiation, it accepts a myriad of parameters that dictate its behavior, including file paths for input and output data (\texttt{input\_filepath} and \texttt{output\_filepath}), paths for saving reports and category mappings (\texttt{report\_path} and \texttt{mapping\_directory}), and various thresholds and configurations for data type detection and conversion. The class is meticulously designed to handle both CSV and Pickle file formats, as indicated by the \texttt{file\_type} parameter, ensuring flexibility in data ingestion. Logging is a core feature, configured during initialization to capture detailed information about the processing stages, with the ability to direct logs to both the console and a specified log file (\texttt{log\_file}). This is achieved through Python's built-in \texttt{logging} module, which is set up to provide real-time feedback on the processing progress and any issues that may arise.

A fundamental method of the \texttt{DataProcessor} is \texttt{clean\_column\_names}, which sanitizes column names by removing any forward or backward slashes, thereby ensuring compatibility and preventing potential errors during subsequent data manipulations. This method iterates over the original column names, applying a regular expression to strip unwanted characters and updating the DataFrame accordingly. Determining the appropriate data type for each column is handled by the \texttt{determine\_column\_type} method, which employs a series of checks and thresholds to classify columns as integers (\texttt{'int'}), floats (\texttt{'float'}), dates (\texttt{'date'}), factors (\texttt{'factor'}), booleans (\texttt{'bool'}), or strings (\texttt{'string'}). This classification is crucial for accurate data conversion and subsequent analysis, as it influences how data is binned and anonymized. The \texttt{convert\_series} method then takes each column and converts it to its identified data type, with special handling for dates—allowing for custom formatting—and factors, which can be optionally converted to integer codes to optimize storage and processing efficiency.

Processing individual columns is streamlined through the \texttt{process\_column} method, which orchestrates the type determination and conversion, logging each step for transparency. This method returns the column name, its assessed type, and the converted series, facilitating the construction of a comprehensive type conversion report. To enhance performance, especially with large datasets, the \texttt{DataProcessor} offers the option to process columns in parallel using Python's \texttt{concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor}, controlled by the \texttt{parallel\_processing} parameter. This concurrency can significantly reduce processing time by leveraging multiple CPU cores, though it requires careful management to avoid race conditions and ensure thread safety.

The \texttt{process\_dataframe} method encapsulates the entire data processing workflow. It begins by reading the input file—either CSV or Pickle—cleaning the column names, and then iteratively processing each column to determine and convert its data type. The method generates a type conversion report, saved to the specified \texttt{report\_path}, which details the original and new data types of each column, providing valuable documentation for downstream processes. Additionally, if the \texttt{return\_category\_mappings} flag is set, the \texttt{save\_category\_mappings} method is invoked to persist mappings of categorical variables to their respective codes, facilitating reproducibility and transparency in how categorical data is handled.

Error handling is robust throughout the \texttt{DataProcessor} class. It gracefully manages scenarios such as missing files, unsupported file types, and data type conversion failures, logging appropriate error messages and halting processing when critical issues are encountered. This ensures that users are promptly informed of any problems, allowing for swift remediation. The final output of the processing pipeline is the cleaned and type-converted DataFrame, saved in the desired format (\texttt{'csv'} or \texttt{'pickle'}) as specified by the \texttt{save\_type} parameter. The \texttt{process} method serves as the orchestrator, sequentially executing data reading, cleaning, type determination, conversion, reporting, and saving, thereby providing a streamlined and efficient pathway from raw data to a ready-to-analyze dataset. Overall, the \texttt{DataProcessor} class is a comprehensive tool that meticulously prepares data for anonymization and analysis, balancing flexibility, performance, and reliability to meet the diverse needs of data scientists and analysts.

\section*{Geocoding Utilities}
The \texttt{geocoding.py} utility module is a comprehensive suite designed to facilitate the geocoding and reverse geocoding processes within the data anonymization and processing application. Central to its functionality is the integration of the \texttt{geopy} library's \texttt{Nominatim} geocoder, which is initialized with a customizable user agent and an extended timeout to enhance reliability. To optimize performance and adhere to Nominatim's usage policies, the module employs a SQLite-based caching mechanism, ensuring that repeated geocoding requests for the same location are served from the cache, thereby reducing unnecessary API calls and speeding up the processing time. This caching system is meticulously managed through the creation of two tables: \texttt{geocache} for forward geocoding results and \texttt{reverse\_geocache} for reverse geocoding outputs, each keyed appropriately to prevent redundant entries.

The module leverages \texttt{spaCy}'s Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities to extract geopolitical entities (GPE) from textual location data, enhancing the accuracy of geocoding by focusing on relevant geographical terms within the data. Functions like \texttt{detect\_geographical\_columns} intelligently identify columns in a DataFrame that likely contain geographical information based on predefined keywords, ensuring that only pertinent data is subjected to geocoding operations. The \texttt{geocode\_location\_with\_cache} function orchestrates the geocoding process by first checking the cache for existing latitude and longitude coordinates before attempting to geocode new locations, thereby streamlining the workflow and conserving computational resources. Additionally, the \texttt{reverse\_geocode\_with\_cache} function performs the inverse operation, translating latitude and longitude pairs back into meaningful geographical descriptors at various levels of granularity, such as address, suburb, city, state, country, and continent. This reverse geocoding process not only enriches the dataset with spatial information but also categorizes it according to specified granularities, facilitating more nuanced data analysis and visualization. The module is further equipped with robust error handling and logging mechanisms, ensuring that any issues encountered during the geocoding processes are promptly recorded and addressed, thereby maintaining the integrity and reliability of the data processing pipeline. Utility functions like \texttt{prepare\_map\_data} aggregate and format the geocoded latitude and longitude data, making it readily usable for mapping and visualization purposes within the Streamlit interface. Moreover, the module ensures that the SQLite cache connection is gracefully closed upon the program's termination through the \texttt{atexit} registration, preventing potential data corruption and resource leaks. Overall, the \texttt{geocoding.py} utilities are meticulously crafted to provide efficient, accurate, and scalable geocoding solutions, seamlessly integrating with the application's broader data processing and anonymization workflows to enhance the dataset's geographical contextualization and usability.

\section*{Binning Optimizer}
The \texttt{BinningOptimizer} class, encapsulated within the \texttt{binning\_optimizer.py} module, is a sophisticated tool designed to optimize the binning of data columns to achieve specific privacy models such as \textbf{k-anonymity}, \textbf{l-diversity}, and \textbf{t-closeness}. Upon initialization, the class accepts a comprehensive set of parameters including the original dataset (\texttt{original\_data}), the desired privacy model (\texttt{privacy\_model}), and various hyperparameters pertinent to the optimization algorithms employed, namely Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing. The constructor meticulously validates the input parameters to ensure they meet the required criteria, such as ensuring that for \textbf{l-diversity} and \textbf{t-closeness}, sensitive attributes are provided and that the thresholds for \textbf{l} and \textbf{t} are within acceptable ranges. It also defines the possible bin counts for each column based on the number of unique values and user-specified minimum and maximum bin constraints, storing these possibilities in the \texttt{possible\_bins\_per\_column} dictionary.

Central to the optimizer is the \texttt{fitness\_function}, which evaluates the quality of a given binning configuration (\texttt{bin\_dict}). This function bins the data using the \texttt{bin\_columns} utility, then assesses compliance with the selected privacy model by calculating penalties: for \textbf{k-anonymity}, it counts the number of groups with fewer than \textbf{k} records; for \textbf{l-diversity}, it sums the deficiencies in diversity across sensitive attributes; and for \textbf{t-closeness}, it measures the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of sensitive attributes in the binned data and the original dataset. Lower fitness scores indicate better adherence to the privacy requirements, and these scores are cached to avoid redundant computations, enhancing efficiency.

The optimizer offers two distinct algorithms to navigate the vast space of possible binning configurations. The \texttt{genetic\_algorithm} method simulates the process of natural selection by maintaining a population of binning configurations, selecting the fittest individuals based on their fitness scores, and generating offspring through crossover and mutation operations. This method iteratively refines the population over multiple generations, progressively honing in on configurations that minimize privacy penalties. Conversely, the \texttt{simulated\_annealing} method employs a probabilistic approach to escape local minima by allowing occasional acceptance of worse solutions based on a temperature parameter that gradually cools. This method iteratively explores the solution space, seeking to identify a global optimum that satisfies the privacy constraints.

The \texttt{find\_best\_binned\_data} method orchestrates the optimization process by first attempting a random sampling phase to quickly identify any binning configurations that already meet the privacy requirements. If such configurations are not found within a specified number of iterations, the method proceeds to the optimization phase using the chosen algorithm (Genetic Algorithm or Simulated Annealing). Throughout this process, progress can be monitored via callbacks, allowing for real-time feedback in user interfaces such as Streamlit applications.

Upon determining the optimal binning configuration, the class provides mechanisms to assess and visualize the compliance with the selected privacy model. The \texttt{check\_privacy} method conducts a thorough evaluation, confirming whether the binned data adheres to the privacy criteria and detailing any deficiencies. Additionally, the class includes plotting functions like \texttt{plot\_k\_anonymity\_compliance}, \texttt{plot\_l\_diversity\_compliance}, and \texttt{plot\_t\_closeness\_compliance}, which generate visual representations of how well the binned data meets the respective privacy standards, aiding users in understanding and validating the anonymization effectiveness.

Furthermore, the \texttt{BinningOptimizer} maintains a history of fitness scores and the time taken for each iteration, enabling users to analyze the optimization trajectory and performance. The \texttt{get\_optimization\_summary} method consolidates these metrics, providing a succinct overview of the optimization outcomes, including the best fitness score achieved, the final binning configuration, and various performance indicators such as total iterations and average time per iteration. In cases where the privacy model is not fully achieved, the class offers recommendations through the \texttt{get\_privacy\_recommendations} method, suggesting adjustments to bin counts, column selections, or preprocessing steps to enhance privacy compliance.

Overall, the \texttt{BinningOptimizer} class integrates advanced optimization techniques with rigorous privacy assessments, delivering a powerful and flexible solution for data anonymization. By systematically exploring and evaluating binning configurations, it ensures that the processed data maintains a delicate balance between privacy protection and data utility, making it an indispensable component of data processing pipelines aimed at safeguarding sensitive information.

\section*{Synthetic Data Generation}
The \texttt{SyntheticDataGenerator} class within the \texttt{synthetic\_data\_generator.py} module is a pivotal component designed to create synthetic datasets that mirror the statistical properties of original data while ensuring privacy and utility. Upon initialization, the class accepts a Pandas DataFrame along with a selection of columns to include in the synthetic data generation process. Users can specify the synthesis method, choosing between \texttt{'ctgan'} and \texttt{'gaussian\_copula'}, each leveraging advanced generative models provided by the SDV (Synthetic Data Vault) library. The class is highly configurable, allowing for the inclusion of additional model parameters through the \texttt{model\_params} dictionary, which facilitates fine-tuning of the synthesizer's behavior to better suit specific dataset characteristics or privacy requirements.

A critical aspect of the \texttt{SyntheticDataGenerator} is its robust handling of data types. If users do not explicitly define categorical, numerical, or datetime columns, the class intelligently auto-detects these types based on the DataFrame's inherent properties. For instance, columns identified as categorical are converted to the \texttt{'object'} data type to ensure they are appropriately processed by the synthesizer, while numerical columns undergo conversion to numeric types with coercion of errors to handle any anomalies. Datetime columns are similarly processed, with attempts made to convert them to datetime objects if they are not already in that format. This meticulous data type management ensures that the synthetic data generated retains the structural integrity and meaningful relationships present in the original dataset.

Handling missing values is seamlessly integrated into the workflow through the \texttt{handle\_missing\_values} method, which offers a variety of strategies such as dropping rows with missing data, mean, median, or mode imputation, and filling with specific values. This flexibility allows users to address missing data in a manner that best preserves the dataset's integrity and the quality of the synthetic output. Once the data is cleansed and properly formatted, the class constructs metadata using SDV's \texttt{SingleTableMetadata}, which is essential for informing the synthesizer about the data's structure and constraints. This metadata is further refined by explicitly setting column types, especially for datetime columns, ensuring that the synthesizer accurately interprets each feature during the training process.

The \texttt{train} method is responsible for fitting the chosen synthesizer model to the prepared data. If \texttt{'ctgan'} is selected, the class initializes an instance of \texttt{CTGANSynthesizer}, configured with the provided metadata and any additional model parameters, and proceeds to train it on the dataset. Alternatively, selecting \texttt{'gaussian\_copula'} initializes a \texttt{GaussianCopulaSynthesizer}, which is then trained similarly. This training phase is critical as it enables the model to learn the underlying distributions and dependencies within the data, which are then replicated in the synthetic dataset.

Once trained, the \texttt{generate} method facilitates the creation of synthetic samples by invoking the synthesizer's \texttt{sample} function, allowing users to specify the number of desired synthetic records. This method ensures that the generated data maintains the statistical properties of the original dataset, making it suitable for downstream tasks such as analysis, machine learning, or sharing without compromising sensitive information. Additionally, the class provides \texttt{save\_model} and \texttt{load\_model} methods, leveraging the \texttt{joblib} library to persist trained models to disk and retrieve them when needed, respectively. This feature is particularly useful for reproducibility and for deploying the synthetic data generation process in different environments or applications.

Throughout its operations, the \texttt{SyntheticDataGenerator} employs Python's \texttt{logging} module to record detailed information about each step, from data type conversions and missing value handling to model training and data generation. This logging capability not only aids in debugging and monitoring but also ensures transparency in the data processing workflow. The class also includes accessor methods like \texttt{get\_model} and \texttt{get\_dataframe}, which allow users to retrieve the trained synthesizer and the processed DataFrame, respectively, facilitating integration with other components of the data processing pipeline or user interfaces such as Streamlit applications. In essence, the \texttt{SyntheticDataGenerator} class offers a comprehensive, flexible, and efficient solution for generating high-quality synthetic data, seamlessly integrating data preprocessing, model training, and data synthesis while maintaining a strong emphasis on configurability and usability.
